  It is April fool!

Today is 1st of April.

In the spirit of procrastination, I hereby write our first post in HeyKabag.

Since the topic is about procrastination... There is nothing to talk about here...

However, I would like to believe that procrastination **can be** done in a more professional way!
After all, there is a **pro** in **pro**crastination.

With this in mind, I'm planning to write more and more topic about procrastination in a software engineering context.
Of course, it will not be today. Let's do that later. When I'm feeling like it.

In the end I would like to quote my own proverb:

> People said you will be less motivated when you declare your own goals.
> IMHO, it is okay to be less motivated. By carefully identify which area you are less motivated with, you will know
> how important the topic is. If it's not important, why bother doing it? Better doing something else, am I right?

There is also another proverb I first heard when playing Persona 3 FEZ:

> If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well.

Thank you for reading, happy 1st of April.
