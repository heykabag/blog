# How to Add your Content

[Home](https://heykabag.netlify.app)

Two important things to know are:

- How the URL routing works
- How to add contents

## How the URL routing works

This folder github repo reflects how the URL itself. This file located at `content/en/blog/how-to-add-your-content.md` and you can access it at [here](/en/blog/how-to-add-your-content/)

## How to add contents

Now we understand that URL is reflected by folder structures, we can create new link by create new file. Add your file inside `content/en/blog`, and it will generate new URL.

You can use any markdown, e.g ~striked words`, or some code

```
defunc method
```

or some `formatted text` like this

Hope we can enjoy writing on this blog
