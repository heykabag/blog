Two important things to know are:

- How the URL routing works
- How to add contents

## How the URL routing works

This folder github repo reflects how the URL itself. This file located at `content/en/docs/Docsy Examples/Tutorials/how-to-add-your-content.md` and you can access it at [here](/docs/docsy-examples/tutorials/how-to-add-your-content/)

## How to add contents

Now that we understand URL is reflected by folder structures, we can create new link by creating a new file. Add your file inside `content/en/docs`, and it will generate new URL.

You can use any markdown, e.g ~~striked words~~, or some code

```
defunc method
```

or some `formatted text` like this

Hope we can enjoy writing on this blog
